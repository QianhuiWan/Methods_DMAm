# Methods for DNA methylation data analyses

## EPIC array data

* Use public data set (GSE126672) to compare different methods since these data are from WI-38 fibroblast cell line, and the difference of DNA methlylation of the two sample groups, contorl and NNMT overexpressed groups, were already known in the publication


* Use placenta data set to comform the differece of results obtained from different methods.
